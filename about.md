<p class="message">
 Hello!  Welcome to my project site.
</p>

I am a hobby developer currently working on jsix and contributor to FreeRDP among other projects.

#### Summary

I am a graduate of the University of Ulster studying in the field of Computer Science (BSc [Hons]) with a **keen** interest in Software Engineering.

Since graduating I have been **assisting** with a range of open source projects hosted here on Github, including FreeRDP and my own C++ runtime JSIX (it's getting there).

As a **passionate** coder, I have investigated a **vast** array of programming languages including cross platform C/C++, JavaScript, HTML5.  I thoroughly **enjoy** investigating new technologies and trying out **new** things.

I hope you enjoy this website and the range of projects I will as I try new things to break the boundaries of what was once impossible.  I look forward to you joining me on this journey to the future.
